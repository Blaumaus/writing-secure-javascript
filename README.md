# Writing secure JavaScript

This repository contains slides from a talk I gave at a WarsawJS conference. JavaScript is the [most popular](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology#most-popular-technologies) programming language in the world, and it is important to know how to use it safely to prevent your applications from being hacked.

This presentation aims to cover common and uncommon vulnerabilities, such as Cross-Site Scripting, Mass Assignment, Path Traversal, CSRF, RCE, Open Redirects and many others and educate people on how to detect and prevent them by showing:
 - Examples of vulnerable JavaScript code;
 - Real life examples;
 - And ways to prevent these vulnerabilities.

This repository contains a PDF formatted presentation:
 - [Writing secure JavaScript, Andrii Romasiun](writing-secure-javascript-by-andrii-romasiun.pdf)

A recording of my speech can be found on [WarsawJS YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63HtFIqKWKY).
